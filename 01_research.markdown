**Incidence and Clinical Characteristics of Virologically Confirmed RSV: An Observational Study of Acute Respiratory Illness (ObservatARI)** \
Co-investigator, Health Economics work package,  \
Funded by Moderna, £4 million, 2023-2025
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a highly infectious seasonal respiratory virus. More precise contemporary data on RSV incidence in the community is needed to assist in planning any new RSV vaccination programme for the elderly.
To deploy point-of-care-testing (POCT) in primary care to provide contemporary data about incidence, clinical presentation and disease burden of virologically confirmed RSV among adults presenting with acute respiratory infection (ARI).
Between November 2023 and November 2024 we will recruit 21 geographically spread practices in England participating in the RCGP Research Surveillance Centre (RSC) based at the University of Oxford. Practices were selected if they were undertaking reference virology sampling for the RSC and had prior experience with undertaking respiratory illness studies. The staff at each study practice will receive training on the appropriate use of the POCT device from the manufacturer, which will be documented on a training log. We will estimate the incidence rate of RSV and use regression models to describe the characteristics of patients with RSV, investigate its clinical features and risk factors, and measure the economic burden of disease.

  Multi-morbidity is a major challenge with substantial implications for NHS resources. 
The aims of this project are to improve understanding of the relationships between socioeconomic status and:
• use of healthcare services by middle-aged and older people with multiple chronic conditions;
• access to primary and secondary care by middle-aged and older people with multiple chronic conditions.
We will focus on people aged 50 and over since multi-morbidity is more prevalent in later life. We define multi-morbidity as occurring when a patient has two or more of 37 health conditions identified in a study by the University of Cambridge. We will use electronic records from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) linked with Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) and Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) data to examine relationships between the number of health conditions, patients’ socioeconomic status and their use of and access to healthcare services. 
We will conduct multivariate analyses of the CPRD data sample and linked HES and IMD data to examine the relationship between the number of health conditions, patients’ socioeconomic status and use of healthcare services.
As a proxy for primary care access, we will estimate, using a dynamic regression (time variant) analysis, the number of A&E attendances (consultant led 24-hour service) recorded in a specified time-period, for patients who self-refer to A&E and are discharged after their attendance.
Using multivariate analysis and Poisson models, we will estimate the numbers of consultations and tests in primary care, visits to A&E departments, outpatient appointments and hospital admissions for groups of patients who suffered a postponed/cancelled appointment before and during the Covid-19 pandemic. This analysis will be useful to explore if the pandemic has exacerbated inequality between socioeconomic groups.

**Temporary GPs and the Effects on Patients' Health Outcomes** \
Joint work with Francesco Moscone, Catia Nicodemo, Cristina Tealdi, and Cristina Orso
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The impact of temporary work has been studied extensively in the literature, but little is known about the implications of temporary work in the healthcare sector. In this paper, we investigate the impact of locum GPs on patients' satisfaction, prescription behaviours, and emergency admissions using a unique dataset that matches the information on temporary contracts for the general practices in England from 2017 to 2021, along with patient satisfaction ratings and psychotropic medication prescriptions. 
We employ panel data techniques that leverage both the cross-sectional and temporal dimensions of the dataset to analyse the relationship between locum GPs and patients' health outcomes. Our findings indicate that patient satisfaction is lower in practices with more temporary job contracts. This result supports the hypothesis that patients may prefer a less precarious relationship with their healthcare providers.  
We also find a negative association between the higher share of locums GPs and antibiotic, infection, analgesic, and statin prescriptions and positive effects on mental health. The reduced time that locums GPs may have to engage with their patients may incentivise them to under-prescribe all these types of medications. This suggests that locum doctors may have an adverse impact on the appropriateness of treatments for patients. However, we do not find any significant effect on the number of emergency admissions at the practice level. 
Our results have significant implications for policy interventions aimed at increasing the flexibility of the labour market in the healthcare sector. Such reforms should also consider the economic and social costs of the changes, including the psychological well-being of patients and the appropriateness of their treatments. Our study highlights the importance of ensuring that temporary work arrangements in healthcare do not compromise the quality of patient care and treatment outcomes.
