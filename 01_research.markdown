**Incidence and Clinical Characteristics of Virologically Confirmed RSV: An Observational Study of Acute Respiratory Illness (ObservatARI)** \
Co-investigator, Health Economics work package,  \
Funded by Moderna, £4 million, 2023-2025

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a highly infectious seasonal respiratory virus. More precise contemporary data on RSV incidence in the community is needed to assist in planning any new RSV vaccination programme for the elderly.
To deploy point-of-care-testing (POCT) in primary care to provide contemporary data about incidence, clinical presentation and disease burden of virologically confirmed RSV among adults presenting with acute respiratory infection (ARI).
Between November 2023 and November 2024 we will recruit 21 geographically spread practices in England participating in the RCGP Research Surveillance Centre (RSC) based at the University of Oxford. Practices were selected if they were undertaking reference virology sampling for the RSC and had prior experience with undertaking respiratory illness studies. The staff at each study practice will receive training on the appropriate use of the POCT device from the manufacturer, which will be documented on a training log. We will estimate the incidence rate of RSV and use regression models to describe the characteristics of patients with RSV, investigate its clinical features and risk factors, and measure the economic burden of disease.

  Multi-morbidity is a major challenge with substantial implications for NHS resources. 
The aims of this project are to improve understanding of the relationships between socioeconomic status and:
• use of healthcare services by middle-aged and older people with multiple chronic conditions;
• access to primary and secondary care by middle-aged and older people with multiple chronic conditions.
We will focus on people aged 50 and over since multi-morbidity is more prevalent in later life. We define multi-morbidity as occurring when a patient has two or more of 37 health conditions identified in a study by the University of Cambridge. We will use electronic records from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) linked with Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) and Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) data to examine relationships between the number of health conditions, patients’ socioeconomic status and their use of and access to healthcare services. 
We will conduct multivariate analyses of the CPRD data sample and linked HES and IMD data to examine the relationship between the number of health conditions, patients’ socioeconomic status and use of healthcare services.
As a proxy for primary care access, we will estimate, using a dynamic regression (time variant) analysis, the number of A&E attendances (consultant led 24-hour service) recorded in a specified time-period, for patients who self-refer to A&E and are discharged after their attendance.
Using multivariate analysis and Poisson models, we will estimate the numbers of consultations and tests in primary care, visits to A&E departments, outpatient appointments and hospital admissions for groups of patients who suffered a postponed/cancelled appointment before and during the Covid-19 pandemic. This analysis will be useful to explore if the pandemic has exacerbated inequality between socioeconomic groups.
