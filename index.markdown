### Welcome to my page,

I am a Research Fellow in Health Economics and Policy Evaluation at the [Center for Health Economics Services and Organisation](https://www.phc.ox.ac.uk/research/institutes-units/centre-for-health-service-economics-and-organisation){:target="_blank"} (CHSEO) and the [Health Economics](https://www.phc.ox.ac.uk/research/groups-and-centres/health-economics-research){:target="_blank"}  group in the [Nuffield Department of Primary Health Care Sciences](https://www.phc.ox.ac.uk/){:target="_blank"} (NDPHCS), Medical Sciences Division, University of Oxford.
My research interests focus on drawing causal inference from non-randomly selected samples; especially in settings of imperfect compliance, cost-effectiveness, the analysis of inequality in health and human capital development, and the evaluation of public policies. I obtained my PhD from [Nuffield College](https://www.nuffield.ox.ac.uk){:target="_blank"}, University of Oxford. Before joining NDPHCS worked as Research Officer at the [ExcludedLives Project](https://excludedlives.education.ox.ac.uk/){:target="_blank"}, University of Oxford; Research fellow in Global Health and Finance at Department of Economics, Ca Foscari, Venice, and Researcher at [Institute for New Economic Thinking](https://www.inet.ox.ac.uk/){:target="_blank"} (INET) and the [Institute for the Evaluation of Public Policies](https://irvapp.fbk.eu/it/){:target="_blank"} (FBK-IRVAPP). 

My research has been published in *Economic Modelling*, Journal of Economic Behavior & Organization*, *Economics & Human Biology*, *Social Science & Medicine*, *Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences*, *Journal of Social Policy*.
